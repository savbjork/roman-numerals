# roman-numerals

Hello! This is my (Savannah Bjorkman's) Roman Numeral coding challenge!

Some helpful information:
1. GitHub: I have never made a GitHub repository before. All my code was in my main.cpp anyway and I included the CMakeList (following the example from my teachers). I hope that is all you need, but I am submitting this before Monday so I can address any transfer related problems with plenty of time.
2. Code: All of my code is in the main.cpp file. The first ~150 lines are my final product, the following ~65 lines are commented out, but were apart of my brain storming process. I didn't use any other written scratch paper or notes to work things out. 
3. Timing: Within the first hour, I could successfully convert a numeral to a decimal. After 2.5 total hours, I could convert a decimal back to a numeral. The next 45 minutes were spent testing, celebrating, and cleaning up my code (most of the clean up can be seen by what I edited out). The rest of my time was spent setting up GitHub, leaving me time to spare!
